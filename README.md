It's so difficult to find the perfect housing solution that fits both our needs and budget.

The cost of house rent depends on many factors such as; the house size, number of bedrooms,floor level, locality, number of bathrooms, halls, and kitchen, furnishing status, and a lot more. With the use of appropriate machine learning algorithms, real estate owners can find the ideal house according to customersâ€™ budgets and preferences with ease.

The objective of this project is to:<br>
I. Implement a machine learning model capable of predicting the house rent for homes.<br>
II. Determine the essential features significantly needed to predict the house rent for homes.<br>
